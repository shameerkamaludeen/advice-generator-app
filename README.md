## Overview

The challenge helps a hand on experience with the very basic API. This is the first API usage from the Frontend mentor if you are following the challenges in order based on the difficulty and the team took care to make very basic usage of the API in this challenge.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- View random advice from each button click
- Fetch advice from a third party API
